## About Anki Hanyu
This is a chrome extension that aims to add a selected word to Anki inventory for you to learn Chinese words.  
The codes use Google Translate API for obtaining the translation of a word as well as Text-to-Speech API for the pinyin, and mostly (99%) are generated by AI.

## Installation
1. Clone the code to your local
2. Download Anki client app and AnkiConnect (Don't forget to restart Anki after installing Add-Ons)
3. Obtain an API key for Google Translate API, Text-to-Speech API and paste it into background.js file
(Do not forget "enable" Google Translate API, Text-to-Speech API)
4. Create a new Deck "Chinese" in Anki
5. Open chrome://extensions and click "Load unpacked", then select the directory of the codes

## How to use
- Select a Chinese word on Chrome and a popup icon will show up just next to it.
